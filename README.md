# Forgot Password Feature

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the "Forgot Password" feature for our application. The purpose of this feature is to provide users with a secure and convenient way to reset their passwords in case they forget them.

## Features

- **Password Reset Request:** Users can initiate a password reset by providing their email address.

- **Password Reset Page:** Users can click on the provided link in the email to access a secure page where they can reset their password.
- **Token Expiry:** The password reset link is time-sensitive and expires after a predefined period for security reasons.
